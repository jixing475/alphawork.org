## Recent news

> The goal of this project was to use artificial intelligence (AI) to discover drug candidates for ADRB2 which can overcome acquired resistance and reduce the limitations of the current drug discovery process, such as high costs and long durations of drug design and production.

Output after completion of the project:

  1. ADRB2 agonist/antagonist candidate compounds
  2. AI-Enabled Pipeline for de-nove Drug Discovery(Still is the first edition at present, still needs the later revision and adjustment)

[`nestr` R-package](https://github.com/emitanaka/nestr) is now on CRAN
